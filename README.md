# OpenGeometry Examples 🔷

Welcome to the OpenGeometry Examples repository! This collection showcases the power and versatility of the OpenGeometry library through interactive demonstrations.

## 🌐 Live Demos

**🚀 [View Live Examples](https://demos.opengeometry.io/src/kernel/)**

Experience all the examples in action directly in your browser! No installation required.

## 📚 What You'll Find

Our examples are organized into three main categories:

### 🔸 **Primitives**
Fundamental 2D geometric shapes that serve as building blocks:
- Lines, Polylines, Circles/Arcs
- Rectangles and more basic forms
- Each with mathematical formulas and properties

### 🔹 **Shapes**
More complex geometric forms built from primitives:
- **2D Shapes**: Polygons and flat geometric forms
- **3D Shapes**: Boxes, Cylinders, and volumetric objects
- **Complex Shapes**: Advanced forms with holes, extrusions, and operations

### 🎯 **Interactive Learning**
Each example includes:
- Live rendering and visualization
- Interactive controls and parameters
- Real-time geometry manipulation
- Educational explanations

## 🛠 Local Development

If you want to run the examples locally:

1. Clone this repository
